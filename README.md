# OpenMasjid Display

**Run prayer timetables, cameras and HDMI on every screen in your masjid — over your network.**

An app for [OpenMasjidOS](https://github.com/hasan-ismail/OpenMasjidOS). Free and open source (AGPL-3.0).

---

OpenMasjid Display turns one small computer (a mini-PC, a Raspberry Pi, or a Proxmox container) into the
control room for every TV in your masjid. Each screen gets its own network video link (**RTSP**) that you
point a cheap RTSP-to-HDMI decoder box at **once** — then you decide, from your phone or a computer, what
each screen shows:

- 🕌 **Prayer timetables** — beautiful, full-screen prayer clocks calculated on the device (no internet
  needed). Make as many as you like, each with its own colours to match the room it hangs in. Shows a large
  live clock (with optional ticking **seconds**), the Hijri and Gregorian dates, every prayer's **Adhan and
  Iqamah** time, Jumu'ah, and a gentle countdown to the next prayer with the current prayer highlighted.
  Design each one in a **live editor** — choose a layout (centered, a next-prayer **spotlight**, or a
  MasjidBox-style split with a big countdown), colours, which elements show, your own **custom background
  image** and **masjid logo** — and watch it update as you type. **Click any name, the masjid title or the footer right in the
  preview to rename it.** A live **sun and moon** arc across the sky by your local time, casting rays and
  glow onto the glass; optionally rotate the layout through the day to gently avoid TV burn-in. Prefer exact
  times? **Upload a whole year of Iqamah times as a CSV** (with a ready-to-edit example you can download).
- 📷 **Cameras** — bring in any IP/security camera or an imam camera and put it on a screen with one tap
  (great for overflow rooms and the women's section). Works with both **RTSP** and secure **RTSPS** links,
  including **UniFi** cameras (turn on RTSP in UniFi Protect and paste the link it shows).
- 🖥️ **HDMI sources** — plug a laptop or a recording into an HDMI-to-network encoder and send it to the
  screens you choose.
- 🗓️ **Schedules** — switch a screen to the imam camera for Jumu'ah, then back to the timetable afterwards,
  automatically. A volunteer can always take over instantly from the simple mobile page.
- 📱 **Volunteer page** — turn on a bone-simple mobile page (its own address, unlocked with a short PIN) so a
  volunteer can see every screen and switch what each shows with a tap — no admin login needed. Enable it and
  set the PIN in **Settings**.

## How it works

```
  Phone / laptop ─▶ Control panel (web)               ┌─ Timetable renderer (SVG → ffmpeg) ─┐
                         │  REST + WebSocket           │                                     ▼
                         ▼                             │                              ┌─────────────┐
                  OpenMasjid Display (Node)  ──────────┘   add/patch paths (API)      │  MediaMTX   │
                         │                              ───────────────────────────▶  │ RTSP server │
                         │  relays cameras / HDMI (on-demand)                          └──────┬──────┘
                         └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │  RTSP/TCP :8554
                                                                                              ▼
                                                          Each TV's RTSP decoder ── rtsp://<server>:8554/tv_xxxx
```

Everything above runs in **one container** — the control panel, the timetable renderer and the RTSP
server ([MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx)) — so there's a single thing to install and update.

- Each screen is a **stable RTSP path** (`…/tv_xxxx`). Switching what a screen shows is a single live API
  call — the decoder keeps the same URL.
- Timetables are rendered to a lightweight low-frame-rate **H.264** stream (built as an SVG, rasterised, and
  encoded by ffmpeg) and published into [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx).
- Cameras and HDMI encoders are **relayed on demand** (only pulled while a screen is watching), or optionally
  re-encoded to a fixed H.264 geometry for maximum decoder compatibility.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design.

## Install (through OpenMasjidOS)

This app installs from the OpenMasjidOS **App Store**. Once it's in the catalog, open your dashboard → App
Store → **OpenMasjid Display** → Install. **There's nothing to fill in** — it's a one-click install.

To add it to the catalog, open a PR to [OpenMasjidAPPS](https://github.com/hasan-ismail/OpenMasjidAPPS)
adding this entry to `registry.yaml`:

```yaml
  - id: display
    repo: hasan-ismail/OpenMasjidDisplay
    ref: v0.20.6
```

### No install-time settings

By design, the install dialog is empty — you set everything up **inside the app** on first run (your
admin password, masjid details, server address, screens, cameras, schedules), all saved to the data volume.
This keeps install one-click and lets you change anything later without reinstalling.

## After installing

1. Click **Open** (the control panel, default host port `7860`). Installed through OpenMasjidOS you're
   signed in automatically and it matches your dashboard's light/dark theme and wallpaper; on a standalone
   install you create a control-panel password the first time.
2. On the **Screens** page, add a screen and **copy its link** — it already points at this server (the
   address you opened the panel with), so there's no IP to look up.
3. In your TV's RTSP decoder, paste the link and set the transport to **TCP**.
4. Pick what each screen shows (a timetable, a camera, an HDMI source). Done.

Full decoder guidance and troubleshooting: [docs/RTSP_SETUP.md](docs/RTSP_SETUP.md).

## Hardware notes (it's meant to be light)

- The timetable stream is mostly static and runs at a low frame rate, so a **Raspberry Pi 4/5** comfortably
  drives one or two screens at 720p. Use a mini-PC for 1080p or many screens.
- Relaying a camera "Direct" costs almost no CPU. The "Most compatible" (re-encode) option is heavier — use
  it on a mini-PC, or only where a screen won't play the camera directly.
- RTSP is forced to **TCP** for the widest, most firewall-friendly compatibility with commodity decoders.

## Run / build from source

```bash
# server (control plane + renderer)
cd server && npm install && npm run build && npm test

# control panel (web)
cd web && npm install && npm run build

# everything together (Docker; also what the App Store runs)
docker compose up -d
```

For local development, run the server with `MEDIAMTX_MANAGED=no` (so it won't try to launch the bundled
MediaMTX) alongside your own `mediamtx`, and `cd web && npm run dev` (proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the
server). In the built container the server launches and supervises MediaMTX itself.

## Security

- Runs least-privilege: no privileged mode, host networking, devices, or Docker socket.
- The control panel is protected by a single admin password (signed, HTTP-only session cookie).
- Installed through OpenMasjidOS it can sign you in with your dashboard login — verified
  **server-to-server** with the platform (never trusting the browser), and it falls back to its own
  password when the platform is absent or unreachable.
- Camera credentials embedded in RTSP links are never shown in the panel.
- On a shared network, set a control-panel password and keep RTSP on your LAN.
